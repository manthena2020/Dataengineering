i thank you all for making me part of your team


In current data world   we are generating petabytes of data from all over the world.

we have many challenges right from analysing that data and processing the data.




 currently challenges we are  facing like 




Data ingestion  issues: 

Data format compatibility: Hadoop supports various data formats 
like Avro, Parquet, etc., and data in different formats may not be directly ingestible.

Data quality: Data quality issues like missing values, incorrect data type, etc., 
can impact the accuracy of results generated from the ingested data.

Data security: Ensuring the security of sensitive data during the ingestion process is crucial,
especially while transferring data over the network.

Scalability: As the volume of data increases,
the data ingestion process must be able to scale up accordingly to handle the increased load.

Monitoring and troubleshooting: Monitoring and troubleshooting of the data ingestion process
can be challenging as it involves multiple components and processes.

Processing tools: 

analysing tools :

integration with cloud services:


To overcome all these issues if  we  cany offer single point of solution as dataops as service 
works really well.





cloud integration issues 

Data transfer limitations: Moving large amounts of data from on-premise systems to cloud-based 
ones can be slow and expensive due to bandwidth constraints.

Compatibility issues: Different cloud services may have different data storage and processing
 formats, making it difficult to integrate them with big data technologies.

Security concerns: Storing sensitive data in the cloud can raise security and privacy concerns.

Cost management: Running big data applications in the cloud can be expensive, especially when 
processing large amounts of data, making it important to carefully manage costs.

Scalability limitations: The scalability of cloud-based big data solutions may be limited by 
the available computing resources, making it important to carefully monitor performance and 
adjust resources as needed.


what has to be focused on  DataKitchen

steep learning curve: Some users find the interface and tools offered by DataKitchen to be complex
and difficult to use.

Limited integration options: DataKitchen integrates with a limited number of tools and systems,
 which may not meet the needs of some users.

High cost: Some users consider the cost of DataKitchen to be high compared to other similar tools in the market.

Lack of scalability: Some users have reported issues with scalability when dealing with large data sets, 
which can impact performance.

Limited reporting and visualization capabilities: DataKitchen provides limited reporting 
and visualization capabilities, which can be an issue for users who require more robust data 
analysis and visualization tools.


data quality check  issues :Duplicate data, ( can we avoid from beginin itself )
