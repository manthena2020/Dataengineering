This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)            yes
                                          leap year
2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)       no 

2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

The condition (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0 
checks if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, 
or if it's divisible by 400. This covers all cases of leap years except
 for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.
 These years are not leap years, so they need to be excluded from the leap year calculation.

For example, the year 2000 is a leap year because it's divisible by both 4 and 400.
 However, the year 1900 is not a leap year because it's divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

	if it is cleanly divisible by 4 and not cleanly divisible by 100 then leap year
    if it is cleanly divisible by 4 and cleanly divisible by 100 and cleanly divisible by 400 then leap year 
	if it is  not cleanly divisible by 4 and  cleanly divisible by 100 and not cleanly divisible by 400 then not leap year
	
	if year % 4 == 0
